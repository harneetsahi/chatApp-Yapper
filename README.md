# Yapper - a chat application

### Technologies and Frameworks:

- Socket-io
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- Tailwind
- Zustand
- MongoDB

I was curious to see how applications like Rocket Chat and Zulip work so I tried to create my own chat application.

### üìã Usage

It's a simple web app where you can chat with anyone who is registered on it.

It has a lot of scope for improvement and in terms of scaling but it was a great project for me to understand how to work with web sockets.

### ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility

The application is accessibile for keyboard and voiceover users. The page is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
